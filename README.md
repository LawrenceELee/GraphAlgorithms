Graph data structures and algorithms

* Unweighted, undirected graphs (DFS, BFS, CC)
  * Depth first search
  * Breathd first search 
    * Can compute shortest path for unweight, undirected graphs
  * Connected componenet
* Unweighted, directed graphs
  * Depth first search
  * Breathd first search
  * Strongly Connected componenet
  * Topological sort
  * Cycle detection
* Weighted, undirected graphs
  * Minimum spanning tree
    * Prim
    * Kruskal
* Weighted, directed graphs
  * Shortest path
    * Dijkstra (no negative weights)
    * Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights)
