Graph data structures and algorithms

* Unweighted, undirected graphs (implicit edges)
  * Depth first search
  * Breadth first search 
    * Can compute shortest path for unweight, undirected graphs
  * Connected componenet
* Unweighted, directed graphs (implicit edges)
  * Depth first search
  * Breadth first search
  * Strongly Connected componenet
  * Topological sort
  * Cycle detection
* Weighted, undirected graphs (explicit edges)
  * Minimum spanning tree
    * Prim
    * Kruskal
* Weighted, directed graphs (explicit edges)
  * Shortest path
    * Dijkstra (no negative weights)
    * Bellman-Ford (handles negative weights)
